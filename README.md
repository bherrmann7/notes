# Notes - a simple wiki

### Notes is a simple wiki.  The idea is to

- collect all content as Markdown.

### TODO
- search on documents
- allow page attachements (inline images, or other files)
- keep all wiki content in a git repo

Together this should serve as a baseline place to keep simple
documents.

### Getting Started

1. Start the application: `lein run`
2. Go to [localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080/) to see: The welcome page


### History

This was originally a Noir project, and I have migrated to pedestal.io
