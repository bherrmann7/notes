## Notes - a simple wiki

Note is a simple wiki.  The idea is to collect all content as
Markdown.  To store it all in a git repo.  And to have a good search
function.  Together this should serve as a baseline place to keep
simple engineering documents.

## Getting Started

1. Start the application: `lein run`
2. Go to [localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080/) to see: The welcome page
